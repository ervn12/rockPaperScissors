An app that allows users to play rock/paper/scissors with a bot and keeps track of your wins/losses & ties.  The game runs server side and we used Express to communicate with the client side.

### What We learned

We learned the core concepts of creating and updating data that's given to us from the server side and how to communicate that back to the client side JS.

### Continued development

When we revisit this project, we would like to add images to the rock/paper/scissors choices and add them to the screen.
